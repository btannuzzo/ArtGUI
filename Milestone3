StatusReport3: Updates

J Bujarski: 
  * The best way to determine the generated picture from the input text would be a web scraper.
    * Pictures can be searched for from Google, and pixel-by-pixel broken down to determine what an "average" picture would be.
    * Libraries to include: requests, BeautifulSoup
  * Picture data can be stored in a 2d array, with ratios created for the downloaded pictures
    * Thus, smaller pictures are spread out to cover as many pixels as larger pictures
    * Average RGB values per pixel stored in an element
    * Overall picture updated on completion of a picture being added.
    * User can input the number of images to use for the "Average" creation
      * Multiprocessing can be used to process several images at once.
    * Libraries to include: pandas(?), matplotlib
